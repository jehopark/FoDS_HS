# Foundtations of Data Science using R for High School, Winter 2021

## Course Description

Data science is the interdisciplinary field of study that involves a wide range of theoretical and technical knowledge to extract valid insights from data. It combines multiple fields including computer science, mathematics, statistics, and particular domains of the physical and social sciences. As more and more data are rapidly produced (e.g., big data), the importance of data science has been increased remarkably in almost all businesses and academic fields. It is now essential to understand how data is collected and processed, how information is displayed, and what kind of insights can be extracted from data in order to make data-driven decisions and conclusions.


This intensive course is designed with a practical approach for high school students with a little or no programing background to teach data manipulation and visualization using R programming language. R is a high-level statistical programming language and computational environment that is widely used in industry and academia these days. The students will be guided to learn the basics of data visualization and manipulation methods in the first three weeks. They move on to more advanced topics in the forth week such as data parsing, user-generated functions, and tidying data. The final 2 weeks are dedicated to practicing and presenting data science skills through a team-based data project. 

Course Goals: Students will understand data science and appreciate the importance of data analytics and visualization.

Part 1: Building Foundations (4 weekends)  
During the Part 1, students will learn the foundations of data science including how to clean, structure, transform, and visualize data to discover and convey information and insights. The primary programming language that we will be using is R, which is both simple to use and was designed to manipulate and analyze data. We will use RStudio. Both R and RStudio are open source, and so may be downloaded to your personal laptop for free.

Textbook for Part 1: We will be using R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This book is open source and can be found online at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/. A Korean version of text is also available online at https://sulgik.github.io/r4ds/. 

Part 2: Practicing Knowledge (2 weeks)  
The Data Science Capstone is a team-based, project-based session, providing an opportunity to apply data science skills and knowledge obtained from the foundation session. Teams of two students, under the direction of the course instructor and teaching assistants, will be working on a data project. The primary objective is to educate the students in solving real world data science problems by leveraging their own computational, statistical, and domain skills. The capstone will end with a final presentation.
