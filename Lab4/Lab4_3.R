#                       ----------------
# Which day of the week has the most number of births?


# Hands-On Review: #1
# Find the path to the dataset file (datasets.xlsx).
# Save the path to the variable `file_path`.

## Your code starts below this line

file_path <- ""

## Your work ends before this line


# Hands-On Review: #2
# Now that you have the path, read the correct sheet from the excel file.
# The correct sheet is the Births2015 data, NOT titanic.
# Save the resulting tibble to the variable `births_2015_data`.
# (Hint: use read_excel() from the library `readxl`. Remember to load the library in the library section above.)

## Your code starts below this line

births_2015_data <-

# Hands-On Review: #3
# Which day of the week has the most number of births?
# (Hint: births_2015_data %>% group_by() %>% summarise(sum()) %>% arrange())
# Save the resulting tibble to the variable `least_births`.
# (Hint: the result should be a tibble: 7x2)

## Your code starts below this line

least_births <-

# Hands-On Review: FINAL ANSWER
# Which day of the week has the most number of births?
# Save the wday name EXACTLY how it appears in the dataset to the variable `final_answer`.
# (ex. if the day is Wednesday, final_answer <- "Wed", if the day is Thursday, final_answer <- "Thurs")
