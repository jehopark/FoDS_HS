What is Data Science?  
=============

Data science consists of the methods and tools for collecting, manipulating, and studying data with a goal of making informed decisions.

What is R?
========================================================
* R is a statistical programming language and environment.
* R is open source/free.
* R is widely used.
* R is cross-platform.
* R is hard to learn (?)

What is not R?
========================================================
* S: R's ancestor
* S-Plus: Commercial; modern implementation of S
* SAS: Commercial; widely used in the commercial analytics.
* SPSS: Commercial; easy to use; widely used in Social Science.
* MATLAB: Commercial; can do some Stats. 
* Python: Also can do some Stats; good in deep learning

Whic is better for Data Science? R or Python?
=============
R is Useful and easier to do __Statistical Modeling and Visualization__

---------

Python has a great collection of libraries to do __Machine learning and Deep Learning__

R Packages
========================================================
- R is known for its community and its huge collection of user-generated packages
- Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library.
- We will install the `tidyverse` package, a collection of R packages for data science

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse') # you can also use RStudio's Packages tab

# You should load dplyr package first to use any functions and datasets in the package
library(tidyverse) 
```

What is RStudio?
========================================================
* Integrated Development Environment for R
* Nice combination of GUI and CLI
* Free and commercial version
* 4 main windows, tabs, etc
* Version control: Git and VPN
* Debugging 
* Documentation: R Markdown
  - install.packages("rmarkdown")
  - http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
* Presentation slides: R Presentation (this one!)


How to Get Help
========================================================
* Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r
* Cross-Validated: the statistics Q&A site http://stats.stackexchange.com/
* Google


[Homework] Where to get help?
=============
- Find Korean websites/community that you can ask questions about R programming.

[Hands-On] First R Project 
========================

- Create a new project named "FoDS_HS"

Documentation: R Markdown 
========================
__R Markdown is our main documentation tool__

- Basic Formatting
  - Global options
  - Text formats
- R Code Chunks
  - Code chunk options
- R Markdown cheat sheet and quick reference
  - https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.HTML

R Markdown Basic Formatting
======================

Open "Basic_formatting.Rmd"


[Hands-On] First R Markdown 
========================
__R Markdown__  

1. Create a new R Markdown (Rmd) file named "My First Rmd"
1. Check if you have knitr package (if not, install it)
1. Check R Markdown Cheatsheet
1. Check this website
https://ntaback.github.io/UofT_STA130/Rmarkdownforclassreports.html#what_is_markdown

[Hands-On] First R Markdown (cont.)
========================
__R Markdown__ 

Let's go over __Section 27.3__ Text Formatting.

- Copy and paste Section 27.3 code snippet into your Rmd file

Visualization with ggplot2: tidyverse package
======================
* Load tidyverse package in your environment
```{r}
# if you don't have the package installed yet
# install.package("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
>> This should load several packages. See the R message on the console. Notice the "Conflicts" -- what does this mean?

Visualization with ggplot2: a quick look
======================
```{r}
# library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class) + 
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
# Compare ggplot() with plot() from base package
base::plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy)
```

>> Let's look at a grammar of graphics

Session 2
===========================
Visualization


Visualization with ggplot2: A Grammar of Graphics
=======================

>> A grammar of graphics is a set of tools for building graphics by adding components and transformations __layer by layer__.  

--

>> Every ggplot2 plot has three key components:
>> - __Data__,
>> - A set of __aesthetic mappings__ between variables in the data and visual properties, and
>> - At least one __layer__ which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a `geom` function.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) + # data
  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) + # aesthetic mapping
  geom_point() # layer (geometric object)
```


Visualization with ggplot2: A Grammar of Graphics
=======================
Most points on the plot form a nice linear relationship while there are some points that don't seem to follow the relationship. What types of cars are they? 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +  
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) # create 
```

```{r}
# Color does not always work for everyone. How about different shapes?
ggplot(data = mpg) +  
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) # Any issue with the shape option?
```

Geometric Objects (geom)
=======================
A __geom__ is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. 

For example:  
- bar charts = bar geoms
- line charts = line geoms
- boxplots = boxplot geoms
- scatter plot = point geoms

>> There are over 40 geoms in ggplot2 package.

Geometric Objects (geom): Where to put aesthetic mapping?
=======================
```{r}
# Using point geom
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
# Using smooth geom
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r}
# We can display multiple geoms in one plot
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Geometric Objects (geom): Where to put aesthetic mapping?
=======================
```{r}
# Using multiple geoms
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() 
  
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) + 
  geom_point() + # Add mapping = aes(color = class) and see the difference
  geom_smooth() 
  
```

Mapping Scope: Global and Local
==========================
Global mapping: the mappings of variables done when the `ggplot()` is called
Local mapping: the mappings of variables done when the geom layer is called

>> Local mapping in a layer overrides the global mapping for that layer.

```{r}
# library(dplyr) # to use `filter` function below

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  aes(x = displ, y = hwy) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + # use the global mapping
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = TRUE) 
  
```

Grammar of Graphics
=====================
Defines a plot as the combination of

1. __Data__
2. __Aesthetic Mapping__
3. __Geometric Object (representation)__
4. (Statistical Transformation)
5. (Position Adjustment)




[LAB1] R Markdown Exercise 
=================
As a team of 2, do all the exercise problems in the sections 27.3:
- 27.3.1 Exercises


(1) First create a new markdown and name it "FoDS+SMU LAB1"

(2) Include the exercise problems and your answers (in Korean if you prefer)

(3) By the end of today, drop your exercise file (.Rmd) in the course Google Drive folder (GDrive's FoDS+SMU > Day1 > Lab1).

*At the end of your markdown, add one more section named "Questions" and include any questions that were not answered during the Lab session. I will try to review those questions and answer them tomorrow.*
