Introduction to Data Science
========================================================
__Today's Goals__

(1) Make sure everyone set the RStudio environment   
(2) Get familiar with RStudio environment  
(3) Create a first R markdown file  
(4) Solve exercise problems and add solutions to a markdown (Lab session)  

What is Data Science?  
=============

Data science consists of the methods and tools for collecting, manipulating, and studying data with a goal of making informed decisions.

[Breakout Session 1] Open Discussion
=================
- Team up!

- Discuss briefly about what the informed decisions might be in your domain/field (5 min)

- Share your team's example(s) in the main room (5 min)

Typical Data Science Project Workflow

What is R?
========================================================
* R is a statistical programming language and environment.
* R is open source/free.
* R is widely used.
* R is cross-platform.
* R is hard to learn (?)

What is not R?
========================================================
* S: R's ancestor
* S-Plus: Commercial; modern implementation of S
* SAS: Commercial; widely used in the commercial analytics.
* SPSS: Commercial; easy to use; widely used in Social Science.
* MATLAB: Commercial; can do some Stats. 
* Python: Also can do some Stats; good in deep learning

Whic is better for Data Science? R or Python?
=============
R is Useful and easier to do __Statistical Modeling and Visualization__

---------

Python has a great collection of libraries to do __Machine learning and Deep Learning__

R Packages
========================================================
- R is known for its community and its huge collection of user-generated packages
- Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library.
- We will install the `tidyverse` package, a collection of R packages for data science

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tidyverse') # you can also use RStudio's Packages tab

# You should load dplyr package first to use any functions and datasets in the package
library(tidyverse) 
```

What is RStudio?
========================================================
* Integrated Development Environment for R
* Nice combination of GUI and CLI
* Free and commercial version
* 4 main windows, tabs, etc
* Version control: Git and VPN
* Debugging 
* Documentation: R Markdown
  - install.packages("rmarkdown")
  - http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/
* Presentation slides: R Presentation (this one!)


How to Get Help
========================================================
* Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r
* Cross-Validated: the statistics Q&A site http://stats.stackexchange.com/
* Google


[Breakout Session 2] Where to get help?
=============
- Find Korean websites/community that you can ask questions about R programming (5 min)
- Suggest them in the main room (5 min)


[Hands-On] Check Your R Environment 
========================

- Check R (if you don't have R, install it now)

- Check RStudio (if you don't have RStudio, install it now)

- Share your screen

[Hands-On] First R Project 
========================

- Create a new project named "FoDS+SMU"

Documentation: R Markdown 
========================
__R Markdown is our main documentation tool__

- Basic Formatting
  - Global options
  - Text formats
- R Code Chunks
  - Code chunk options
- R Markdown cheat sheet and quick reference
  - https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.HTML

R Markdown Basic Formatting
======================

Open "Basic_formatting.Rmd"


[Hands-On] First R Markdown 
========================
__R Markdown__  

1. Create a new R Markdown (Rmd) file named "My First Rmd"
1. Check if you have knitr package (if not, install it)
1. Check R Markdown Cheatsheet
1. Check this website
https://ntaback.github.io/UofT_STA130/Rmarkdownforclassreports.html#what_is_markdown

[Hands-On] First R Markdown (cont.)
========================
__R Markdown__ 

Let's go over __Section 27.3__ Text Formatting.

- Copy and paste Section 27.3 code snippet into your Rmd file


[LAB1] R Markdown Exercise 
=================
As a team of 2, do all the exercise problems in the sections 27.3:
- 27.3.1 Exercises


(1) First create a new markdown and name it "FoDS+SMU LAB1"

(2) Include the exercise problems and your answers (in Korean if you prefer)

(3) By the end of today, drop your exercise file (.Rmd) in the course Google Drive folder (GDrive's FoDS+SMU > Day1 > Lab1).

*At the end of your markdown, add one more section named "Questions" and include any questions that were not answered during the Lab session. I will try to review those questions and answer them tomorrow.*
