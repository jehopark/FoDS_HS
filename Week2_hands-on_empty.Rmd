## Hands-On 1: Filter and Logical Operators

1. Find all flights that departed in November or December. 11월 또는 12월에 이륙한 비행기
```{r}
nov_dec_flight <- # Fill-in #
```

1. Find all flights that weren’t delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours (120 min)
두시간 이상 delay되지 않은 비행기

```{r}
lessthan2hourdelay1 <-  # Fill-in #
lessthan2hourdelay2 <-  # Fill-in #
lessthan2hourdelay1 == lessthan2hourdelay2
```

## Hands-On 2: Arrange and Find
1. Sort `flights` to find the most delayed flights. 가장 오래 연착된 노선을 찾으시오. Find the flights that left earliest. 가장 빨리 출발한 노선을 찾으시오.

```{r}
arrange( # Fill-in # )
```


1. Which flights traveled the farthest? Which traveled the shortest?
```{r}
arrange( # Fill-in # )
```
