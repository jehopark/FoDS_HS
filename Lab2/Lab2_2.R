# Ex 5.3.1: #3.1 (modified)
# Use mutate() to add a new variable to flights that represents the speed in miles per second.
# Remember: speed = distance (miles) / time (seconds)
# Save the result to a variable, flights_with_speed.


## Your code starts below this line

flights_with_speed <-

# Ex 5.3.1: #3.2 (modified)
# Use arrange() to sort flights_with_speed to find the fastest (highest speed) flight's carrier code.
# Save the result to a variable, flights_sort_speed.

# Use filter() on airlines to identify which airline corresponds to the carrier code.
# Hint: filter(airlines, carrier = ???)
# Save the result to a variable, fastest_airline.
