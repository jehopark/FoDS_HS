1. Practice what youâ€™ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.

2. Using the R Markdown quick reference, figure out how to:

Add a footnote.
Add a horizontal rule.
Add a block quote.

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

The most striking feature of the diamonds dataset is that there are so many small carat diamonds in the world!
